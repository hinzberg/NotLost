# NotLost

This repository is a fork of Mohammad Azam's repo of the same name. 
His idea was to place some coordinates in augmented reality and use the app during hiking trips. 
I have taken the liberty of adding some changes.

## Update 2022-04-18

- Replaced the coordinates with some landmarks in my hometown.
- The distance is displayed in kilometers instead of miles.
- The number formatting of the distance corresponds to the current culture.
- Every location now has an additional location name.
- The AR Location Label looks much nicer.

* This app is not yet tested in real world so please don't rely on this app to give you 100% accurate directions. 

Mohammad Azam also did a short video of his version:
